    <h1>It's not easy, but it is essential.</h1>

<p>Last month I wrote about e-commerce. This month’s topic, customer experience, is somewhat related. Obviously, customer experience (CX) has been of critical importance ever since Grog sold Grok the first stone tool. But the rise of e-commerce over the last decade has forced businesses to take a closer look at their CX, and many of them aren’t liking what they see. </p>

<p>According to Accenture’s <a href="https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insight-managing-b2b-customer-experience" title="2015 B2B Customer Experience Survey" target="_blank">2015 B2B Customer Experience Survey</a>, 86 percent of B2B executives consider CX “very important,” but only 23 percent of the companies surveyed could actually report strong results from their CX initiatives. </p>

<p>Easy access to information has changed the traditional customer experience from a linear path (discovery, consideration, evaluation and purchase) to one where business customers are continuously evaluating the products and services available to them. Businesses must be able to offer seamless, cross-channel CX, instead of just focusing on improving discrete touchpoints. </p>

<p>In other words, it’s not the destination, it’s the journey. So how do companies that excel at managing CX journeys do it? I wish I could tell you there’s some secret fix that won’t cost you a dime, but there isn’t. </p>

<p><strong>They start with service. </strong> B2B customer experience leaders don’t view service as a separate and final phase of the customer lifecycle. They don’t sell products; they sell the results that come from a combination of product and service only they can provide. Leave continuing education, preventative maintenance or technical assistance to others, and you’re likely to be replaced by them.</p>

<p><strong>They over-invest in digital. </strong>Leading companies devote a large chunk of their CX budgets to e-commerce—including customer self-service, digital sales and service integration—as well as digital marketing, collaboration tools and mobile enablement. </p>

<p><strong>BUT, they also over-invest in traditional customer service avenues.</strong> Digital didn’t make contact centers, field service and CRM systems disappear; it just made the weaknesses in these platforms stand out even more. </p>

    Businesses must be able to offer seamless, cross-channel CX, <br>instead of just focusing on improving discrete touchpoints.

  </aside>

<p>So, where to start? Look at the data, and patterns might emerge—not just the types of customers you have, but how, when and why they interact with you. Understanding how you’re helping (or impeding) your clients along these paths will take some additional qualitative research. </p>

<p>Then comes the hard work of instituting lasting organizational change. The key here is not to be a dictator; the root causes of poor CX almost always stem from disconnects within the organization. Your team has to acknowledge those disconnects before they buy in to any changes. As the ones who know the system best, they’re also the ones best suited to finding solutions that work, if they’re giving the power to do so. </p>

<p>Luckily, effective customer experience changes often boil down to simplifying a bloated system. What emerges will likely be more efficient, more cost-effective and more satisfying to customers. Take a look at your CX strategy. Does it align with your company’s brand promise? If you’re up to the challenge, we can help. </p>
